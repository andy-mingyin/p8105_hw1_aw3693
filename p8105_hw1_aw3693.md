\##Problem 1

``` r
#load the penguins dataset
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

``` r
# Code to get the numbers of rows, columns and mean of flipper_length_mm column
dataset_rows <- nrow(penguins)
dataset_cols <- ncol(penguins)
mean_flipper_length = mean(penguins |> pull(flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE) 
```

The important variables are `species`, `bill_length_mm`, and
`flipper_length_mm`. The penguins data set contains 344 rows and 8
columns. The mean flipper length is 200.92 mm.

``` r
#Make a scatter plot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x) and save it
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point() + labs(
    x = " Bill length in mm", 
    y = "Flipper length in mm", 
    title = "Scatterplot of Flipper Length vs Bill Length"
  )
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

``` r
ggsave("penguins_scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

    ## (`geom_point()`).

## Question 2

``` r
# make a data frame
set.seed(1)  
df <- data.frame(
  random_sample = rnorm(10), 
  logical_vector = rnorm(10) > 0,
  character_vector = sample(letters, 10),
  factor_vector = factor(sample(c("Level1", "Level2", "Level3"), 10,  replace = TRUE))  
)
```

``` r
# take the mean of each variable
mean_random_sample = mean(df |> pull(random_sample) )
mean_logical_vector = mean(df |> pull(logical_vector) )
mean_character_vector = mean(df |> pull(character_vector) )
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, character_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor_vector = mean(df |> pull(factor_vector) )
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, factor_vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

The random_sample and logical vector work, since random_sample is
numeric and logical vector contains true and false, which are 1 and 0
respectively. The character vectors and factor vectors do not work,
since we cannot take the average of characters, and factors are
categorical.

``` r
#convert variable to numeric
numeric_logical_vector = as.numeric(df |> pull(logical_vector))
numeric_character_vector = as.numeric(df |> pull(character_vector))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
numeric_factor_vector = as.numeric(df |> pull(factor_vector))
```

For the Logical vector, true becomes 1 and false becomes 0, then we
could calculate the mean

For the character vector, the conversion does not work and returns NA
values, since characters cannot be directly converted to numeric.

For the factor vector,the conversion to numeric works, but the numeric
values correspond to the factor levels, level 1, level 2, level 3. Then,
we could take the average of factor vector, but it is not meaningful.
